# ðŸ’§ Image-Based Water Turbidity Analysis System

This project is a **Python GUI application** for analyzing water turbidity from images using **OpenCV** and **Tkinter**.  
It calculates key turbidity metrics such as **NTU**, **red channel histogram**, **edge density**, and more.

A professional **PDF report** is generated after analysis, complete with a color-coded turbidity bar and visual histogram.
